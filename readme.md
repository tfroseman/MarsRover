I could not decide on a style that I liked but think that this provides some
 middle ground. It is by no mean idiomatic javascript but I tried to keep 
 in sane and straightforward. I have not included any tests as I have spent 
 comulativly roughly 2 ish hours and wanted to show what I was able complete in that time 
 limit. I broke up my time writing over a few different periods so I ended up having
 more time to chew it over and think about how I wanted to write parts.
